# Email-Recipient-Extractor
This Python script is designed to extract email recipients from incoming emails sent by a specific sender. It connects to a Gmail IMAP server, searches for emails from the specified sender, and extracts the recipient email addresses. The extracted email addresses are then saved to a text file while ensuring that duplicates are removed.
